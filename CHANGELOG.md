### New Features

 - <csr-id-e8dececac6d4b98f3f0983b6ef60d832d9f28bab/> Add serde serialization module
   Add comprehensive serde serialization support for BarkML AST nodes:
   
   - Add ValueSerializer for serializing to BarkML Value types
   - Add StatementSerializer for serializing to BarkML Statement types
   - Support all Rust primitive types, collections, structs, and enums
   - Provide to_statement() and to_value() convenience functions
   - Include error handling with descriptive error messages
   - Add extensive test coverage for serialization scenarios
   
   This enables programmatic generation of BarkML AST from Rust data structures.
 - <csr-id-943c786a68e0f7a35e528fb04f8a12d5b9a42d1a/> add serde deserializer module for Statement and Value types
   Implement comprehensive serde deserialization support for BarkML AST nodes:
   
   - Add ValueDeserializer for deserializing from BarkML Value types
   - Add StatementDeserializer for deserializing from BarkML Statement types
   - Support all BarkML data types including primitives, arrays, tables, and enums
   - Provide from_statement() and from_value() convenience functions
   - Include comprehensive error handling with descriptive error messages
   - Add extensive test coverage for various deserialization scenarios
   
   This enables direct deserialization of Rust structs from parsed BarkML AST,
   making it easier to work with BarkML configuration data in Rust applications.

> Users can now define a precision for integers using standard rust suffixes (u8, i8, u16, i16, u32, i32, u64, i64).
> Users can also define a precision for floating point numbers using suffixes (f32, f64)

Changes:

* Merged Value and Statement into one enum for easier use

## 0.2.0 - Binary encoding support
